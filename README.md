The Jora Mall project is a modern, full-stack e-commerce application designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience. It's built with a focus on robust functionality, secure user interactions, and efficient product and order management.

Core Purpose:
Jora Mall aims to be a user-friendly online marketplace where customers can browse and purchase products, manage their orders, and handle payments securely. For administrators, it offers comprehensive tools to manage the product catalog and track customer orders.

Key Features:

Secure User Accounts: Users can easily register, log in, and manage their profiles. All sensitive information, like passwords, is securely handled.

Intuitive Shopping Experience: Customers can effortlessly browse products, search by keywords, filter by categories or price, and add items to their shopping cart.

Comprehensive Cart Management: Users have full control over their cart, allowing them to adjust quantities, remove items, or clear their entire cart before checkout. The system also intelligently manages product stock to prevent overselling.

Streamlined Order Processing: Users can place orders with their chosen shipping address. Admins can then track and update the status of these orders from "pending" to "delivered."

Flexible Payment Options: The platform integrates with Paystack for secure online payments, offering a reliable way for customers to complete their purchases.

Integrated Wallet System: A unique feature allowing users to top up an in-app wallet via Paystack and use their wallet balance to pay for orders, providing an alternative and convenient payment method.

Admin Control Panel: Dedicated functionalities for administrators to add new products, update existing ones, remove outdated items, and oversee all customer orders.

Technology Behind Jora Mall:

The project leverages a powerful and popular technology stack:

Frontend: Built with React, a leading JavaScript library for dynamic user interfaces, styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.

Backend: Powered by Node.js and the lightweight Express.js framework, handling API requests, user authentication (with JWT and Bcrypt.js for security), and business logic.

Database: Utilizes MongoDB Atlas, a flexible cloud-based NoSQL database, to store all application data.

Deployment: Both the frontend and backend are deployed on Render, a cloud platform that simplifies continuous deployment from GitHub.

In essence, Jora Mall is a complete e-commerce solution, designed for efficiency and scalability, providing a solid foundation for online retail operations.
